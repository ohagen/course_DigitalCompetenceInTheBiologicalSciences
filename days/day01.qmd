## Learning goals

By the end of this day, you should be able to:

-   explain what data represents and what it does not
-   distinguish data lifecycles (stages) e.g. data entry, data storage, data analysis
-   recognize common sources of mistakes
-   learn core principles of data handling and management
-   use Excel to enter and structure biological data in a controlled way
-   understand that every dataset is a simplified representation of
    reality

No prior experience with Excel or programming is required.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Motivation

Biology deals with complex, variable systems.

Data are **not reality**.\
Data are a **structured representation** of selected aspects of reality.

Before we analyze anything, we must understand: - what was observed, -
how it was recorded, - and what information was lost in the process.

Poorly structured data cannot be rescued by sophisticated analysis
later.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Agenda

**13:30–14:15 \| Block 1 – Introduction and course framing**

-   How this course is structured (5 days, Excel → R)
-   How we will work: alone and in pairs, hands-on, reflection
-   Where materials, data, and exercises live (course website / GitHub)
-   Short introduction: who I am
-   Belize protected-area case study


**14:15–14:30 \| Break** ☕️

**14:30–15:15 \| Block 2 – What data is (and what it is not)**

-   Overview of the data lifecycle and where Excel fits in
-   Examples of spreadsheet failures
-   Data vs reality: observations, variables, metadata
-   Data as a simplified representation of complex systems
-   Good vs bad tables: diagnosing common problems
-   Why structure matters more than software

**15:15–15:30 \| Break** ☕️

**15:30–16:15 \| Block 3 – Hands-on: structured data entry in Excel**

-   Rules for analysis-ready tables
-   Enter biodiversity monitoring data using a provided template
-   Work in pairs (driver / navigator)
-   Identify and discuss emerging inconsistencies

**16:15–16:30 \| Reflection, discussion, and outlook** 🧠

-   What was harder than expected?
-   Which problems cannot be fixed later?
-   What questions remain open?
-   Preview of Day 2: summarizing and visualizing data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Context: a real-world case study

Throughout this course, we work with a simplified but real world scenario:

> You are working with biodiversity monitoring, conservation planing and foresty data from a national protected area in Belize.\
> Data are collected by yourself, rangers, partner NGOs, and external consultants over long periods of time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is data?

Deliberately tool-agnostic and discipline-neutral.

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-6}
::: {.card .border-primary}
::: {.card-header .bg-primary .text-white}
Short version
:::
::: {.card-body}
**Data are recorded observations about the world.**
:::
:::
:::

::: {.g-col-6}
::: {.card .border-primary}
::: {.card-header .bg-primary .text-white}
Longer version
:::
::: {.card-body}
**Data are representations of observations, measurements, or events**, encoded in a form that allows **storage, comparison, and interpretation**.
:::
:::
:::
:::

> Data are **not facts themselves**, they are **encodings of facts**.

This distinction matters: tools only operate on the encoding, never on reality.

---


## Core comcepts definition

In this course, we use the following working definitions:

- **Observation:** something you perceive or record in the world  
  e.g. one species observation at one location and time

- **Measurement:** an observation made using a rule or instrument  
  e.g. “Tree height = 12.4 m measured with a clinometer.”
  
- **Variable**: a property that can vary between observations\
  e.g. species name, height, location, date, time, count

- **Data:** the recorded representation of that measurement  
  e.g. a value in a table: `height = 12.4`
  
- **Dataset**: a collection of observations recorded in a structured form
  e.g. a spreadsheet or CSV file with many rows and columns
  
- **Metadata**: information about how, when, where, and why data were collected
  e.g. units, methods, location, observer, context

Once written down, data are detached from the original context unless you preserve it.

---
---

## What counts as data in biology?

In biology, data can take many forms:

- **numbers** (e.g. body mass, abundance, concentration)
- **categories** (e.g. species name, habitat type)
- **text** (e.g. field notes, descriptions)
- **images** (e.g. microscopy, camera traps)
- **sequences** (e.g. DNA, RNA, proteins)
- **time series** (e.g. temperature, population size)
- **spatial coordinates** (e.g. GPS locations)

**Key point**  
Data are always **abstractions of reality**, never reality itself.

This is why interpretation without context is dangerous and wrong.

---

## Why context matters: metadata

Data without context are dangerous.

That context is called **metadata**, for example:

- units  
- methods  
- time  
- location  
- who collected it  
- how it was collected  
- what assumptions were made  

### Example: There is data, and there is data

| Recorded value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 12.4 | meaningless |
| 12.4 m | better |
| 12.4 m; tree height; clinometer; dry season; treeID766; transect A; observer O. Hagen | usable |

**Rule of thumb:**  
- **Data + metadata = information**  
- **Data without metadata = confusion**  

This is *exactly* why FAIR stresses **rich metadata** and standardization: without it, your “data” are not really reusable.

---

----------

## The FAIR principles (what they really mean)

The FAIR principles describe how scientific data should be handled so that they remain **useful beyond the moment they are collected**.

FAIR does **not** mean “open to everyone” and it does **not** guarantee data quality.  
FAIR means that data are prepared in a way that allows **others (and your future self)** to find, understand, and reuse them.

We present FAIR principles expanded from  
[Wilkinson et al. (2016), *The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship*](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18)  
by the wider research data management community. 

**FAIR** stands for:

### 🔍 Findable

**What it means**  
Data can be *discovered* by humans and machines.

**In practice, this requires**
- a clear name or identifier
- descriptive metadata
- a stable location (repository, database, archive)

**Why it matters**
If data cannot be found, they effectively do not exist for science.

> A file on your laptop called `final_data_v3_REAL.xlsx` is not findable.

---

### 🔓 Accessible

**What it means**  
Once found, it is clear **how the data can be accessed**, even if access is restricted.

**In practice, this requires**
- a clear access procedure
- documented permissions or licenses
- long-term availability

**Why it matters**
Accessibility is about *clarity*, not openness.  
Even restricted data must explain **how access works**.

> “Email the author” is not a sustainable access strategy.

---

### 🔗 Interoperable

**What it means**  
Data can be combined with other data and used by different tools.

**In practice, this requires**
- standard formats (e.g. CSV, not proprietary-only files)
- consistent units
- controlled vocabularies
- clear data types

**Why it matters**
If every dataset uses its own conventions, integration becomes untractable.

> `12`, `12.0`, `12 m`, and `twelve` are not interoperable without context.

---

### ♻️ Reusable

**What it means**  
Data can be **understood and used correctly** in a new context.

**In practice, this requires**
- rich metadata
- documented methods
- clear assumptions
- provenance (who did what, when, and how)

**Why it matters**
Reuse without context leads to misinterpretation and error.

> Data without metadata are numbers without meaning.

-------------------------------------------------------------

## Data are not neutral

This is important and often missed.

Data depend on:

- what you chose to measure  
- what you ignored  
- instrument precision  
- human judgement  
- classification decisions  

In ecology, for example:

- species presence depends on **detectability**  
- absence is rarely true absence  
- counts depend on **effort**  

So data always embed theory, assumptions, and bias.

---


## Why this matters for tools like Excel and R

Tools don’t understand meaning. They only manipulate symbols.

- Excel does not know what a species is.  
- R does not know what a tree is.  
- Both only see strings, numbers, and dates.

That’s why:

- **Excel can silently change your data** (auto-conversion, formatting surprises)  
- **R forces you to be explicit** (types, scripts, reproducible steps)

**Bottom line:** the responsibility for meaning stays with the scientist.

---




------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data as a model

Every dataset is already a **model**:

-   it includes some aspects of reality
-   it excludes others
-   it simplifies complex systems

This idea will return later in statistics and modelling courses.

For now, remember:

> Data are never neutral.\
> Choices are made at the moment of data collection.

Excel is widely used because it is:

-   easy to access
-   human-readable
-   flexible

Excel is **well suited** for: - data entry - inspection - small-scale
summaries

Excel is **not well suited** for: - enforcing consistency - documenting
decisions - scaling analyses

Understanding these limits is part of digital competence.

## Spreadsheet Failures lead to Financial, Policy, and Health Costs

Before we look at biological and environmental data, it is worth understanding
*why spreadsheets deserve respect*. The cases below are not about beginners.
They involve intelligence agencies, governments, banks, and elite academics.

These failures occurred because spreadsheets silently changed data, hid assumptions,
or scaled beyond what they were designed for.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🕵️📞🎯❌ MI5 wiretapped the wrong people  
*(UK intelligence error)*

A spreadsheet formatting issue altered the last three digits of phone numbers
to `000`, leading to **134 incorrect surveillance targets**.
The error originated from automatic formatting in a spreadsheet.

**Source:** The Guardian  
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/28/microsoft-excels-bloopers-reel-40-years-of-spreadsheet-errors

**Lesson**  
- Automatic data conversion can silently change identifiers.

**Why it matters**  
- Intelligence and security systems rely on *exact identifiers*.
- A single formatting error can redirect surveillance to innocent people.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🦠📉🚫📋 Nearly 16,000 COVID-19 cases lost in England   
*(Public health reporting failure)*

During the COVID-19 pandemic, **15,841 positive cases** were omitted from official
statistics because a CSV file was opened in Excel and **truncated at the row limit**.
Contact tracing was delayed and incomplete as a result. Can we even calculate the true impact of these errors?

>In modern Microsoft Excel (including Office 365 / Microsoft 365) the maximum number of rows per worksheet is 1,048,576. You cannot add more rows in a single sheet beyond that limit; if you try to import data that exceeds this, rows beyond the limit may be truncated. The maximum number of columns is 16,384 (column XFD Support Microsoft).

**Source:** The Guardian  
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/05/how-excel-may-have-caused-loss-of-16000-covid-tests-in-england

**Lesson**  
- Excel has *hard limits* (row counts) that are invisible until exceeded.

**Why it matters**  
- Incomplete data leads to flawed epidemiological response.
- Delayed contact tracing can plausibly translate into **preventable infections and deaths**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 📊➗⚠️🏛️  Reinhart & Rogoff economic growth error 
*(Influential academic policy failure)*

A highly cited economic study claimed that countries with debt above 90% of GDP
experienced sharply reduced growth.
It was later discovered that an **Excel formula excluded large parts of the data**,
significantly altering the result.

**Source:** The Guardian  
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/28/microsoft-excels-bloopers-reel-40-years-of-spreadsheet-errors

**Lesson**  
- Hidden formula errors can persist even in peer-reviewed research.

**Why it matters**  
- This work influenced **austerity policies worldwide**.
- Spreadsheet mistakes can shape economic policy affecting millions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 💰📑❌🏦   Fannie Mae misreported over \$1 billion
*(Financial reporting failure)*

In 2003, the U.S. mortgage giant reported quarterly results containing
**over \$1 billion in accounting errors**, traced back to an incorrect Excel formula.

**Source:** The Guardian  
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/28/microsoft-excels-bloopers-reel-40-years-of-spreadsheet-errors

**Lesson**  
- Formula logic in spreadsheets is rarely audited or tested.

**Why it matters**  
- Financial misreporting undermines investor trust and regulatory oversight.
- Small spreadsheet mistakes can become *material financial risks*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🐋📉💣🏦 JPMorgan “London Whale” \$6 billion loss  
*(Risk modelling failure)*

A trading loss of approximately **\$6 billion** was linked to risk models
managed through manually edited Excel spreadsheets.
Cut-and-paste workflows and poor version control amplified risk.

**Source:** The Guardian  
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/28/microsoft-excels-bloopers-reel-40-years-of-spreadsheet-errors

**Lesson**  
- Manual workflows lack audit trails and reproducibility.

**Why it matters**  
- Risk systems must be automated, tested, and transparent.
- Spreadsheet-based models do not scale safely.

## Spreadsheet Failures in Biology and Environmental Sciences

Spreadsheet misuse has caused **systematic scientific errors**, not just technical inconveniences. These are particularly relevant for biologists, where identifiers, codes, and metadata matter. The case study below a more in depth examples in genomics. However, all the issues above are also applicable to many diverse Environmental data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Gene name auto-conversion errors in genomics

Spreadsheet software automatically converts certain character strings
into dates or numbers. In genomics, this silently corrupts gene names
such as `SEPT2`, `MARCH1`, or `DEC1`, which are converted into dates
(e.g. `2-Sep`, `1-Mar`, `1-Dec`) without warning.

Large-scale scans of published supplementary Excel files show that
**around 30% of papers containing gene lists are affected**.

**Concept that would have prevented this** 

- Explicit data typing (text ≠ date ≠ number) 
- Avoiding spreadsheet auto-formatting for identifier columns 
- Using plain-text formats (CSV/TSV) with scripted imports

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What all these failures have in common

Across intelligence, finance, economics, public health, and scientific research the same patterns recur:

- Silent data transformation  
- Hidden assumptions and formulas  
- Hard limits that are easy to exceed  
- No version control or audit trail  
- Tools used beyond their design scope
- Organic design / Changing specs
- Lack of testing
- Lack of relevant knowledge and skills

**Spreadsheets did exactly what they were told.  
Humans misunderstood what they were doing.**

This is why learning to use these tools *properly* matters.
And this is why this course starts with Excel discipline,
but does not end there.


------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Concept that would have prevented this** - Separation of raw data and
derived results - Version control instead of manual file duplication -
Explicit metadata and data dictionaries

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Environmental and ecological data: the same failure modes

In environmental monitoring and ecology, spreadsheet problems usually
appear as: - inconsistent site or species codes - mixed units within a
single column - missing values encoded inconsistently (`NA`, `-`,
blank) - formulas copied across misaligned rows

While individual ecological cases are less publicized, the mechanisms
are identical to those documented in public health, genomics, and
finance.

**Concept that would have prevented this** 

- Well designed data entry
- Skilled and knowledgeable users
- Treating spreadsheets as *data entry interfaces* and *quick overview tools*, not databases
- Validation rules and controlled
vocabularies 
- Early transition to scripted, reproducible workflows

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Core data concepts reinforced by these cases

Across all examples, the same principles recur:

-   **Data types must be explicit**
-   **Identifiers must never be auto-transformed**
-   **Raw data must be immutable**
-   **Analysis must be reproducible** (easier in script languages, but more on day 3)
-   **Metadata is part of the data**

These principles motivate why this course starts with Excel discipline,
but quickly moves to R and Quarto.
