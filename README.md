# course_DigitalCompetenceInTheBiologicalSciences
Digital tools (mostly MS Excel and R) and data literacy for biological sciences

This repository contains the teaching materials for the course Digital Competence in the Biological Sciences, taught at Goethe University Frankfurt by Prof. Oskar Hagen. Detailed information on course structure, learning objectives, and organization is provided in the accompanying lecture slides.

The course introduces students to fundamental concepts of data literacy and the responsible use of digital tools in biology. Starting from data entry and structuring in spreadsheets, it progressively moves toward data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reproducible reporting using R and Quarto. Emphasis is placed on understanding the data lifecycle, avoiding common pitfalls, and developing workflows that support transparency, reproducibility, and FAIR data practices.
