## Course overview

This course introduces biology students to **digital competence in data handling** using Excel and R. Excel and R are used as **complementary tools** but principels are software agnostic within a broader best practices in data lifecycle, from data entry to reproducible analysis. Thus, the focus is not on programming for its own sake, but on understanding how biological data are:
- recorded,
- structured,
- summarized,
- transformed,
- interpreted,
- and communicated.

The course is hands-on, biology-driven, and designed for students with **no prior programming experience**.

- The lecture introduces concepts (data, statistics, algorithms, modelling).
- This course makes those ideas **tangible through practice**.

Topics such as inferential statistics, formal modelling, and machine learning are **not taught here**, but students are conceptually prepared for them.

## Teaching Philosophy

::: {.callout-note}
**This is not a YouTube tutorial.**
Interrupt me. Ask questions. Tell me when something doesn’t make sense. Dialogue makes this course better for everyone.
:::

* 🧠 **Critical thinking and context trump technical skills**
  We’re not here to memorize functions or paths in Excel. We’re here to think carefully about what data mean, how they’re collected, and why they matter.

* 🎯 **Tools serve questions, not the other way around**
  R and Excel are just tools. You should always know what you’re trying to ask or answer first.

* 🧩 **Structure matters more than software**
  Whether it’s a notebook or a database, how your data are organized determines what’s possible downstream.

* 🔁 **Reproducibility is part of scientific responsibility**
  Your future self (and your collaborators) need to understand what you did and why. Think of code and data as shared lab notes.

* 🐛 **Errors are normal and informative**
  They’re not signs of failure—they’re clues. Every bug is a question you’ve been invited to ask.

* ⚖️ **Understanding limits is as important as getting results**
  No tool or model gives truth. Knowing when something breaks matters more than making it work.

## Case study

All exercises are based on a **real-world biodiversity monitoring and conservation scenarios** from a national protected area in Belize. Data are inspired by actual monitoring programs, but simplified for teaching purposes and modified to avoid unnecessary sensitive information sharing.

Using a single evolving case study will allow you to focus on:
- reasoning instead of context switching,
- continuity across days,
- real world data problems rather than artificial examples.

## Course structure

The course runs for **5 days (3 hours each)**. Each day builds on the previous one and is divided into three 45 minutes lectures and/or exercises with two 15 minute breaks in between and a final 15 minute wrap-up sessions.

---

### **Day 1 – What 'good' Data Is **  
*From observations to structured tables (Excel in context)*

- Observations, variables, metadata
- Data as a simplified representation of reality
- Risks of inconsistency and missing context
- The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in Excel
- Data life cycle and FAIR principles overview
- Designing analysis-ready tables and entry templates

**Key idea**  
All datasets are already models of reality. Basic organization of data. Basic data quality issues.

---

### **Day 2 – Describing Data **  
*Descriptive statistics and visualization (Excel to R)*

- Summary statistics: centre, spread, outliers
- Mean, median, variance
- Distributions and variability
- Visualizations as summaries, not proofs
- Honest and misleading plots
- Repeated tasks and scalability
- Transition from Excel to R
- First R contact: import data, compute summaries, make a plot
- Reading and writing: CSV/TSV safely, encoding basics

**Key idea**  
Descriptive statistics summarize observations, not explanations. Summary statistics and visualizations are tools to understand data. Further doing data visualization.
Testing assumptions and groups differences from data on Dayu one

---

### **Day 3 – From repetition to algorithms**  
*Why R exists*

- Algorithms as explicit procedures
- Programming logic 101 and pseudocode
- Core Atomic Data Types in R including missing values (e.g. NA, NaN, Inf, -Inf, NULL, etc.)
- Common Data Structures (vectors, lists, data frames, matrices, arrays)
- Vectorized thinking Loops and conditionals
- Functions and arguments
- Functions: using them, then writing tiny ones
- Packages and R philosophy



**Key idea**  
A small toolbox script: import, check, summarise, plot. Algorithms replace memory and intuition with explicit instructions.

---

### **Day 4 – Cleaning data and making work reproducible**  
*R as a data workbench*

- Cleaning as scientific work: decisions, assumptions, traceability
- Tidy data: reshaping and joining tables
- Quality control checks as code, CI, and tests
- Documentation: comments, READMEs, and metadata
- Reproducibility: scripts, projects, folder structure
- Data cleaning as scientific work
- Data transformation and reshaping
- Scripts as documentation
- Reproducible workflows
- Version control basics (Git)
- Creating automated reports with R (Quarto: one-button from raw data to figures pdfs, docs and websites)

**Key idea**  
If you cannot rerun it, you cannot defend it.

---

### **Day 5 – Tools, models, and scientific responsibility**  
*Synthesis and outlook*

- Models as simplified representations
- Official course evaluation (admin part)
- Tool choice as a scientific decision
- What you wanted (from previous daily feed backs or unfinished business)
- Remembering strengths and limits of Excel and R in the Data Lifecycle
- Course reflection and open discussion

**Key idea**  
All models are wrong. Some are useful.

## What you will be able to do after this course

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- Gain an overview of what excel and scripting languages can and can not do 
- Organize biological data in a structured and transparent way
- Use Excel appropriately for data entry and exploration
- Use R for basic data cleaning, summaries, and plots
- Understand what algorithms and models are at a conceptual level
- Judge which tool is appropriate for a given task
- Document workflows clearly for reuse and reproducibility

## How to use this website

- This website is the **main source** for the course
- All materials, exercises, and datasets are available here
- Slides are optional; the pages themselves are complete
- If something is not documented here, it is not required

## Looking ahead

The skills and concepts introduced here form the foundation for:
- statistical inference,
- modelling,
- bioinformatics,
- data-driven biological research.
- and real world biological work.

This course is not the end of digital competence training.  
It is the **starting point**.
