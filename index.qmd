## Course overview

This course introduces biology students to **digital competence in data handling** using Excel and R. Excel and R are used as **complementary tools** but principels are software agnostic within a broader best practices in data lifecycle, from data entry to reproducible analysis. Thus, the focus is not on programming for its own sake, but on understanding how biological data are:
- recorded,
- structured,
- summarized,
- transformed,
- interpreted,
- and communicated.

The course is hands-on, biology-driven, and designed for students with **no prior programming experience**.

- The lecture introduces concepts (data, statistics, algorithms, modelling).
- This course makes those ideas **tangible through practice**.

Topics such as inferential statistics, formal modelling, and machine learning are **not taught here**, but students are conceptually prepared for them.

## Teaching philosophy

- Critical thinking and context trumps technical skills
- Tools serve questions, not the other way around
- Structure matters more than software
- Reproducibility is part of scientific responsibility
- Errors are normal and informative
- Understanding limits is as important as getting results

Students work alone and in pairs throughout the course, enabling individual thinking and collaborative learning.

## Case study

All exercises are based on a **real-world biodiversity monitoring and conservation scenarios** from a national protected area in Belize. Data are inspired by actual monitoring programs, but simplified for teaching purposes and modified to avoid unnecessary sensitive information sharing.

Using a single evolving case study will allow you to focus on:
- reasoning instead of context switching,
- continuity across days,
- real world data problems rather than artificial examples.

---

## Course structure

The course runs for **5 days (3 hours each)**. Each day builds on the previous one and is divided into three 45 minutes lectures and exercises with two 15 minute breaks in between and a final 15 minute wrap-up sessions.

---

### **Day 1 – What 'good' Data Is **  
*Excel as a data entry and structuring tool*

- Observations, variables, metadata
- Data as a simplified representation of reality
- Risks of inconsistency and missing context
- Excel templates for structured data entry

**Key idea**  
All datasets are already models of reality.

---

### **Day 2 – Describing Data **  
*Excel for descriptive statistics and visualization*

- Mean, median, variance
- Distributions and variability
- Visualizations as summaries, not proofs
- Honest and misleading plots

**Key idea**  
Descriptive statistics summarize observations, not explanations.

---

### **Day 3 – From repetition to algorithms**  
*Why R exists*

- Repeated tasks and scalability
- Algorithms as explicit procedures
- Deterministic workflows
- Transition from Excel to R

**Key idea**  
Algorithms replace memory and intuition with explicit instructions.

---

### **Day 4 – Cleaning data and making work reproducible**  
*R as a data workbench*

- Data cleaning as scientific work
- Data transformation and reshaping
- Scripts as documentation
- Reproducible workflows

**Key idea**  
If you cannot rerun it, you cannot defend it.

---

### **Day 5 – Tools, models, and scientific responsibility**  
*Synthesis and outlook*

- Models as simplified representations
- Tool choice as a scientific decision
- Strengths and limits of Excel and R
- Course reflection and open discussion

**Key idea**  
All models are wrong. Some are useful.

---

## What you will be able to do after this course

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- Gain an overview of what excel and scripting languages can and can not do 
- Organize biological data in a structured and transparent way
- Use Excel appropriately for data entry and exploration
- Use R for basic data cleaning, summaries, and plots
- Understand what algorithms and models are at a conceptual level
- Judge which tool is appropriate for a given task
- Document workflows clearly for reuse and reproducibility

## How to use this website

- This website is the **main source** for the course
- All materials, exercises, and datasets are available here
- Slides are optional; the pages themselves are complete
- If something is not documented here, it is not required

---

## Looking ahead

The skills and concepts introduced here form the foundation for:
- statistical inference,
- modelling,
- bioinformatics,
- data-driven biological research.
- and real world biological work.

This course is not the end of digital competence training.  
It is the **starting point**.
