Data provenance notice

----------------------
All items in this folder are synthetic placeholders. They mimic the structure and formatting of real datasets used in Belize, but no real or confidential data are present.

Folder descriptions
- csv/: Downloaded example tables from public internet sources. Each file should retain its own source-provided metadata where available.
- Foresty/: Working area for forestry trial data. Subfolders such as GAP_Data_2019 and GAP_Data_2020 contain data on the area and PLOT contain synthetic measurements for mahogany gap-planting trials.
- PSP/: Permanent Sample Plot mock data illustrating long-term plot measurements.
- templates/: Prototype layouts (e.g., PSP/) showing expected file organization for incoming data. Those facilitate data entry and avoid further later data lifecycle issues.

Usage notes
- Treat these files as structural and formatting guides only; replace with validated field data as needed.
- Keep source metadata with any real downloads added later to preserve provenance and context.
