## Overview

This document lists the main **operator groups in R**, with **tables** and **minimal examples**.

Operators are symbols (and a few special names) that act on values or objects, e.g., `+`, `<-`, `==`, `%in%`.

## Assignment operators

| Operator | Meaning | Notes |
|--------:|---------|------|
| `<-` | assign (preferred) | standard in R |
| `->` | assign (rightwards) | rare |
| `=` | assign in some contexts | safe in function arguments |
| `<<-` | assign in parent environment | advanced |

~~~r
x <- 10
10 -> y
~~~

---

## Arithmetic operators

| Operator | Meaning |
|--------:|---------|
| `+` | addition |
| `-` | subtraction |
| `*` | multiplication |
| `/` | division |
| `^` | exponentiation |
| `%%` | modulo |
| `%/%` | integer division |

~~~r
2 + 3
10 %% 3
10 %/% 3
~~~

---

## Relational operators

| Operator | Meaning |
|--------:|---------|
| `<` | less than |
| `<=` | less than or equal |
| `>` | greater than |
| `>=` | greater than or equal |
| `==` | equal |
| `!=` | not equal |

~~~r
x <- c(3, 5, 7)
x > 4
~~~

---

## Logical operators

### Element-wise

| Operator | Meaning |
|--------:|---------|
| `&` | AND |
| `|` | OR |
| `!` | NOT |

~~~r
(x > 4) & (x < 7)
~~~

### Short-circuit

Short-circuit operators only evaluate the right side if needed, which is helpful to guard expensive or error-raising code.

| Operator | Meaning |
|--------:|---------|
| `&&` | AND |
| `||` | OR |

~~~r
TRUE && FALSE
FALSE && stop("This is never evaluated")
TRUE || stop("Also never evaluated")
~~~

---

## Membership operator

| Operator | Meaning |
|--------:|---------|
| `%in%` | element in set |

~~~r
c("oak","pine") %in% c("oak","beech","pine")
~~~

---

## Indexing operators

| Operator | Meaning |
|--------:|---------|
| `[` | subset |
| `[[` | extract element |
| `$` | extract by name |

~~~r
lst <- list(a=1:3,b=4)
lst$a
~~~

---

## Sequence operator

| Operator | Meaning |
|--------:|---------|
| `:` | integer sequence |

~~~r
1:5
~~~

---

## Namespace operators

| Operator | Meaning |
|--------:|---------|
| `::` | exported object |
| `:::` | internal object |

~~~r
stats::median(1:5)
~~~

---

## Formula operator

| Operator | Meaning |
|--------:|---------|
| `~` | formula |

~~~r
lm(y ~ x, data=df)
~~~

---

## Pipe operators

Pipes pass the left-hand value into the function on the right, helping you read code from left to right.

| Operator | Meaning |
|--------:|---------|
| `|>` | base pipe |
| `%>%` | magrittr pipe |

~~~r
# base pipe: value becomes the first argument
1:5 |> mean()

# base pipe with placeholder for a later argument
letters |> paste(collapse = "-" |> \(sep) paste("Letters:", ., sep = sep))

# magrittr pipe often used with tidyverse
mtcars %>%
  subset(cyl == 4) %>%
  aggregate(mpg ~ gear, data = _, FUN = mean)
~~~

---

## Special infix operators

| Operator | Meaning |
|--------:|---------|
| `%*%` | matrix multiplication |
| `%o%` | outer product |
| `%x%` | Kronecker product |

---

## Summary

| Group | Operators |
|------|-----------|
| Assignment | `<-`, `->`, `=`, `<<-` |
| Arithmetic | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `%%`, `%/%` |
| Relational | `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=` |
| Logical | `&`, `|`, `!`, `&&`, `||` |
| Membership | `%in%` |
| Indexing | `[`, `[[`, `$` |
| Pipes | `|>`, `%>%` |
